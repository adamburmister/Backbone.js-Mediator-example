This is an example Backbone.js application using the mediator pattern.

There are a number of outstanding issues with it. Do not use this code. This repository exists so I can ask questions on the newsgroup about this codebase.

Usage:
This application was built using the brunch.io tool.
To run the application use:
`%> brunch server --watch`
